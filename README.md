# Higher order component

hoc is pattern that hold share logical funtionality to needed component

if a functionality logic dupicated into components we take that
functionalit logic into function. we takes component as an argument to this function. we return new component that returns parametred component. this function has function logic duplicated across components and passed through wrapped components which component we take as argument.

In this snippet counter logic extracted into this Higher order component.
